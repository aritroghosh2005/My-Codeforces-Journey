<div class="header"><div class="title">D2. Unique Values (Hard version)</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>2 seconds</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The difference between the easy version and hard version is the maximum number of queries allowed. In this version, it is 33.</span></p><p>There is a secret array $$$a$$$ of length $$$2n+1$$$, whose elements are integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each value appears exactly twice, except for one value, which appears exactly three times.</p><p>Your goal is to find the three positions of the value that appears three times.</p><p>To do this, you may ask the following query at most 33 times: </p><ol> <li> Choose an integer $$$k$$$ and an array $$$s$$$ of $$$k$$$ distinct indices between $$$1$$$ and $$$2n+1$$$. </li><li> You will receive the number of different values among $$$a_{s_1}, a_{s_2}, \ldots, a_{s_k}$$$ that appear exactly once, or, in other words, the count of values that are not repeated. </li></ol><p>For example, if the values $$$a_{s_1}, \ldots, a_{s_k}$$$ are $$$\{2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 6, 7\}$$$, the answer to the query will be 3, as 1, 6, 7 are the only values that appear exactly once. 3 appears 2 times and 2 appears 3 times, which is more than once, so they are not counted.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$).</p><p>The array $$$a$$$ is fixed for the test case and does not change during the interaction. In other words, the interactor is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not adaptive</span>.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^4$$$.</p></div><div><div class="section-title">Interaction</div><p>For each test case, first read a single integer $$$n$$$.</p><p>You may ask up to $$$33$$$ queries in each test case.</p><p>To ask a query, print a line in the format:</p><ul><li> ? $$$k$$$ $$$s_1$$$ $$$s_2$$$ $$$\ldots$$$ $$$s_k$$$ ($$$s_i \neq s_j$$$ for $$$i \neq j$$$, $$$1 \le s_i \le 2 \cdot n + 1$$$)</li></ul><p>As a response to the query, you will receive the number of different values among $$$a_{s_1}, a_{s_2}, \ldots, a_{s_k}$$$ that appear exactly once, or in other words, the count of values that are not repeated.</p><p>If your program makes more than $$$33$$$ queries for one test case, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be $$$-1$$$. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Wrong Answer</span>. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.</p><p>When you determine the answer for the current test case, print</p><ul><p> </p><li> ! $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ $$$z$$$</li></ul><p>where $$$x, y, z$$$ are the distinct three indices of the value that appears three times in $$$a$$$. You can print indices in any order.</p><p>Note that this output does not count towards the query limit of $$$33$$$.</p><p>After that, proceed to the next test case or terminate your program if there are no more test cases.</p><p>After printing each query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush* the output. Otherwise, you will get the <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Idleness limit exceeded</span> verdict.</p><p>If, at any interaction step, you read $$$-1$$$ instead of valid data, your solution must exit immediately. This means that your solution will receive <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Wrong Answer</span> because of an invalid query or any other mistake. Failing to exit can result in an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.</p><p>Note that the interactor is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not adaptive</span>, which means that $$$a$$$ is unchanged throughout the interaction.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Hacks</span></p><p>To make a hack, use the following format.</p><p>The first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 500)$$$, the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case should contain $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \le n \le 1000)$$$.</p><p>The second line of each test case should contain an array of length $$$2 \cdot n + 1$$$, the array $$$a$$$, which should fulfill the constraints of the problem.</p><p>The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^4$$$.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id007691263586778131" id="id0021745087423180753" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id007691263586778131">1
